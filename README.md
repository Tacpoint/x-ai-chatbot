## Usage

### Start the Chatbot

To start the chatbot with scheduled posting and mention monitoring:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or in production:

```bash
npm start
```

### Create a Single Post

To create a post without waiting for the scheduler:

```bash
npm run post -- --topic "Web development tips" --media
```

Options:
- `--topic`: The topic for the post (default: "software development and design")
- `--media`: Include an image with the post (flag)
- `--poll`: Include a poll with the post (flag)

If approval is enabled, the post will be sent to Slack for review before publishing.

### Check Mentions Manually

To check for new mentions and reply if appropriate:

```bash
npm run check-mentions
```

If approval is enabled, any generated replies will be sent to Slack for review before publishing.

### Check Pending Approvals

To manually check and process any pending approvals:

```bash
npm run check-approvals
```

## Slack Integration

When Slack integration is enabled, the system will:

1. Send all generated posts to a designated Slack channel for approval
2. Allow team members to approve, reject, or edit content directly in Slack
3. Automatically publish approved content to X
4. Send notifications of published content to a notification channel

### Setting Up Slack

1. Create a Slack app with the following permissions:
   - `chat:write`
   - `chat:write.public`
   - `incoming-webhook`
   - `commands`
   - `channels:read`

2. Install the app to your workspace
3. Create channels for approvals and notifications
4. Add the app to these channels
5. Configure your webhook URL and OAuth token in `.env`
